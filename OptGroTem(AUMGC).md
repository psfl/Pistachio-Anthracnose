#' @description Optimal Growth Temperature - using the AUMGC (optimal temperature for the mycelial growth of \emph{Colletotrichum karstii}      
#' (Ck, n=1) and \emph{C. #' fioriniae} (Cf, n=6) tested for six different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 Celsius degree).       
#' For each combination of isolate (n=6) and temperature (n=6), three plates (repetitions were prepared). Each repetition received one       
#' mycelial plug of 4 mm from a 5-day-old colony, transferred to the center of a new Acidified PDA plate. Plates were incubated at the        
#' respective temperatures and two perpendicular diameters (mm) were daily measured from day one to day seven. Experiment was repeated      
#' three times).
